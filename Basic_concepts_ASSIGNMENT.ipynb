HINT: create a variable named total_candies_to_load and take the input from the user on how many candies to be loaded on to the vending machine print the vending machine title as \"🍬🍬Candy Vending Machine🍬🍬\" and print total number of candies loaded into the vending machine along with it. create a variable named numberOfCandiesUserWants to store the number of candies required by the user accept the number of candies the customer wants as an input into the variable numberOfCandiesUserWants that we created in the previous step and if the number of candies required by the customer is less than zero or greater than total number of candies in the machine, print “You have entered number of candies which is either zero or less than zero and is not possible to disperse please try again or visit once again Thanks for shopping with us!!! we will be happy to serve you once again” Using the concept of nested loops, print the amount the customer has to pay given cost of 1 candy = 1$.
